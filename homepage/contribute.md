## Providing feedback

Feedback is always welcome. The more constructive it is, the more impact it will have.

The easiest way to provide feedback is through
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/eclipse/packages/issues) of the project.

## Improving an existing package

There is always room for improvement. Found a bug, have an idea how to make things better.
Make a change and create a pull request.

## Enhancing an existing package

Got a cool idea on adding something new to an existing package. It makes sense to create an issue on GitHub,
and discuss your proposal. The existing maintainers of a package might want to understand how this fits
into their package, what the benefit is, and what is required. Get in contact, get on the same page, and start coding.

## Creating a new package

Next, open a new PR against this repository, adding your package. Please ensure that:

* The new package brings together at least two Eclipse IoT projects
  * There is a real benefit in the combination of the projects
  * You only use stable, released versions of the projects (no milestones or snapshots)
* The package contains only open source components, license compatible with the EPLv2
* You describe your motivation in the PR
* The package contains at least:
  * A basic introduction and idea behind this package
  * The Helm charts to deploy
  * A tutorial what do to once the deployment is done
* You take ownership of the package

## The legal side of things

If you plan on contributing code, you will need to
[create an Eclipse Foundation account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register),
and [sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/eca).

Is this required? Yes! Is there a way around it? No! Why is this necessary? Because legal
issues are as though as software engineering issues, and this is the way to solve them.
